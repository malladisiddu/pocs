  **CVE-2022-44268**
ImageMagick is susceptible to revealing information. When processing a PNG image, such as for resizing, the result might contain data from any file if the software has the required access privileges. ImageMagick can read and process images that contain embedded text chunks. These can include additional information about a given image, such as comments, captions, or other metadata. The root cause of this ImageMagick vulnerability is that it doesnâ€™t properly validate input it receives from text chunks. Thus an attacker can embed malicious code into an image text chunk (e.g., raw profile) and trick the software into executing it. Theft of login credentials or other stored data then becomes likely. To leverage this vulnerability, an attacker would need to find a way to deliver a malicious image to a targeted user, perhaps by sending it as an email attachment or hosting it on a website. If the recipient then processes the image in ImageMagick, the code is executed and the attacker is able to exfiltrate sensitive information. This vulnerability affects the PNG image format handled by ImageMagick that contains a tEXt chunk.
